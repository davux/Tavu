-- Tavu
-- Written by David Ammouial <da HAT weeno DOUBT net>


== What is it? ==

    Tavu allows remote programs to use DBUS notification system.
    The network communication between the remote program and DBUS
    is performed using the XMPP (Jabber) protocol.

== How does it work? ==

    - On one side, you have Tavu running locally, waiting for incoming
      messages via Jabber.
    - On the other side, you have a program that sends messages to Tavu,
      for example irssi script 'jabber_hilight_notify.pl'.

    When Tavu receives a message, it triggers a DBUS notification, which
    comports the following information:
     1. the application that sent the notification via Jabber,
     2. the summary of the event,
     3. the body of the event.
    Any of these 3 values can be defined in the configuration file, and may
    include parts of the message, like $subject, $body, $sender, etc.. This
    gives great flexibility in the way you interact with the remote application.

    For example, the summary may be sent in the subject of the message, the
    text of the message can (obviously) be sent in the message body, and the
    name of the application may be the resource. Alternatively, the name of the
    application may be the name associated to its JID in the roster.
