-- Tavu
-- Written by David Ammouial <da HAT weeno DOUBT net>


== What is it? ==

    Tavu allows remote programs to use your local KDE notification system
    (aka knotify). The network communication between the remote program and
    knotify is performed using the XMPP (Jabber) protocol.

== How does it work? ==

    - On one side, you have Tavu running locally, waiting for incoming
      messages via Jabber.
    - On the other side, you have a program that sends messages to Tavu,
      for example irssi script 'jabber_hilight_notify.pl'.

    When Tavu receives a message, it triggers a KDE notification. A KDE
    notification has 3 main characteristics:
     1. the application that triggers it,
     2. the name of the event,
     3. the message itself.
    Any of these 3 values can be defined in the configuration file, and may
    include parts of the message, like $subject, $body, $sender, etc.. This
    gives great flexibility in the way you interact with the remote application.

    For example, the name of the event may be sent in the subject of the
    message, the text of the message can (obviously) be sent in the message
    body, and the name of the application may be the resource. Alternatively,
    the name of the application may be the name associated to its JID in the
    roster.
