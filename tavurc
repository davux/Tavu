[Event information]
;; Here you can customize how Tavu will generate a DBus notification when a new
;; message arrives. A DBus notification is mainly described by 3 parameters:
;; application name, summary, and body.
;; In addition to normal text, the following variables are available:
;;  - $sender: the name of the sender (from the roster). Fallbacks to the bare
;;             JID if there is no name or if the sender is not in the roster.
;;  - $senderjid: the bare JID (without resource) of the sender.
;;  - $senderresource: the resource of the sender.
;;  - $subject: the message subject.
;;  - $body: the message body.
;;
;app name = $senderresource
;summary = $subject
;body = $body

[Message filters]
;; Values for 'accept':
;;     self, roster, roster+self, list, roster+list, all, none
;accept = roster+self
;; Comma-separated list of jids. Used if accept=list or accept=roster+list.
;list = foo@project.org, jack@domain.net, mary@company.com
